# Joeys-site
My website in long development.


This website will have many functions such as ?, ?, and ?.

Changes should be daily but as this is currently private I will not yet.

This project is fully maintained right now by me and it not maintained by anyone else, anyone who claims is not, report them using our report tool (coming soon)

All the images and/or games are for non-profit use. The images will be free images credited within our about page, if you have a problem with either access the contact form and submit one for quickest and easiest responce.
