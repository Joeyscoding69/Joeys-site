## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there is an issue with the project that requires immediate attention, you can email me at sprap6969@gmail.com and I will get back as soon as possible! All **Security** requests 
that are proven to be true are *rewarded* in one way or another!

If I email back that your vulneribilty report has come back true, you will be rewarded for your time, effort, and dugilidance. If it comes back completely false, I will email back
that it has shown false and you will not be rewarded. If it is false but has reason for report on a basis of how it seems, you will also be rewarded!
